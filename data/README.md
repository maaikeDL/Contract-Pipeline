# Data Directory

This directory contains all data files and datasets used in your data pipeline project. You can ignore this folder in git, such that the data is not uploaded to GitHub. You may decide to upload it, if it's not confidential, and if the size of your dataset allows it. We do recommend, if possible, to add a snippet of your dataset, for demonstration purposes.

## Directory Structure

- `raw/` - Original, immutable data files as received from sources
- `.../` - 

## Example Data Files

For demonstration purposes, this template includes sample e-commerce data:
- Customer transactions
- User data

## Data Security

- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude data files

## File Formats

Recommended formats by use case:
- **CSV**: Or TSV, simple tabular data, rather than Excel files.
- **JSON**: Semi-structured data, API responses
