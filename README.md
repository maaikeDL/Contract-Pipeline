## Getting Started

This template repository contains example e-commerce data and code to demonstrate the recommended project structure. **Replace the example content with your own project while using this folder structure as a starting point.** Deviations to the structure are allowed, depending on your project needs.

### Step 1: Setup
1. Clone this template and create your own repository
2. Review the folder structure and example files to understand the layout

### Step 2: Planning
3. Choose your business domain and data problem
4. Complete the project proposal in `docs/project-proposal.md`
5. Get instructor approval before proceeding

### Step 3: Implementation
6. Replace sample data in `data/raw/` with your own datasets
7. Rewrite the Python modules in `src/` for your specific use case
8. Update configuration files in `config/` for your data sources
9. Modify `requirements.txt` to include only the libraries you need

### Step 4: Final Deliverable
10. Remove all template content, instructions, and example code
11. Ensure your repository contains only your project implementation


## Project Requirements

Your final project must include:

**Required Components:**
- **At least 3 data engineering pipeline steps** from the list below
- **Executive Report**: Management-focused summary (max 3000 words)
- **Technical Documentation**: Clear documentation of your implementation
- **At least 1 Test**: Unit test or integration test for your code

**Data Engineering Pipeline Steps (choose at least 3):**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract data from various sources
2. **Data Processing**: Clean, transform, and validate data
3. **Data Storage**: Design and implement appropriate storage solutions
4. **Data Pipeline**: Automated, scheduled data workflows
5. **Analytics/ML**: Generate insights or build predictive models
6. **Monitoring**: Track pipeline performance and data quality

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Technical Implementation** (40%): Model quality, code quality, architecture, and best practices
- **Business Value** (25%): Relevance and impact of your solution
- **Data and AI Engineering** (20%): Pipeline design, security, scalability, and reliability
- **Documentation** (15%): Clear documentation and presentations

## Support

- Use weekly check-ins to track progress
- Submit your project proposal for approval
